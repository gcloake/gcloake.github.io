I find during the early stages of a migraine playing with words a helpful distraction. Forewarning, therefore, that there'll be plenty more poetry bleakness. Proponents of accupressure will claim there's more to it, but I've always felt those '<a href="https://www.heart.co.uk/lifestyle/wellness/mum-cures-migraines-with-food-bag-clip/">relief clips</a>' a weak alternative to fingernails in your scalp: that's the stage I reach at least. Any distraction is a good distraction though and qualifying the pain can strangely take it away.

I recently finished 'A Brain Wider Than the Sky' by Andrew Levy. A fascinating account of living with migraine with some similar themes to my own. With this in mind, I wrote the below during my last attack.

> A heavy smog lies on my brow, seeps down my neck towards my nape. *I thought you had gone?* I think, I wish, but instead you settle for the rest of the day. You leave at night: a senseless respite, of calm and potential wasted in bed. So long have you stayed that at times I don’t mind— just be quiet, ‘til tomorrow when I’ll see you again.
