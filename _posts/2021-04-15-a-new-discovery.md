> A new discovery,  
> ripe to the mind.  
> A familiar feeling  
> yet different this time.
>
> Sticks snapped,  
> and stones softened.  
> Free to create  
> without worry or remorse.
>
> Ideas haunt,  
> ready to gorge.  
> Through lofty ambitions  
> I must know more.
>
> In the same month,  
> the feeling may wander.  
> But until then  
> it absorbs my all.
