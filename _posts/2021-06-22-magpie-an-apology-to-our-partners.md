Above the eaves lives a magpie
who I blame for many things:
stolen seeds, spilled milk,
shoes by the door.

Yet you don't deserve this reputation,
these presumptions of mine.
I should see you as a blessing
the beauty that you bring.

Forgive me for lacking patience,
my accusations and ire.
Alone I'd have just sorrow
but together there is joy.

Continue to look over me magpie,
my friend of several years.
Condemn me not, as I do you,
and stay for many more.
