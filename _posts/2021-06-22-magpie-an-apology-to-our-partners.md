Magpies have a fascinating cultural history, differing greatly across the world. Demon to some, sacred to others. A common site in the UK, I've had the opportunity to observe one (Eurasian magpie) this summer visiting my roof. After a rocky start, I'm optimistic we can reach a truce for next spring.

> stolen seeds, spilled milk,  
> shoes by the door.

> But you don't deserve this reputation,  
> these presumptions of mine.  
> I should see you as a blessing,  
> the beauty that you bring.
>
> Forgive me for lacking patience,  
> my accusations and ire.  
> Alone I'd have but sorrow--  
> together there is joy.

> Continue to look over me magpie,  
> my friend of many years.  
> Condemn me not, as I do you,  
> and stay for many more.
