> I’m fine without directions,  
> yet a fire and I’m not fine,  
> though wouldn’t it be nice to be not lost—  
> willing and supine.
>
> *You only need ask* I hear you say  
> Though my stubborn mouth squirms tight.  
> Instead I guard, from afar,  
> worried and contrite.  
>
> But to travel well you can’t go alone  
> or so I’ve begun to see.  
> This life is full of others too:  
> I can be the absentee.
>
> My mind cannot always guide me,  
> but then a stranger’s will,  
> and a stranger’s hands will save me,  
> when I lack the skill.
>
> So ask for help, let a little go,  
> now to passers-by I’ll say—  
> “I *am* a bit lost but that’s just fine  
> because we’re heading the same way.”
