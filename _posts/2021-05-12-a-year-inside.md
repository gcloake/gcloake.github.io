I feel like time has changed over the last year. Many of us have had more of it, but not been able to use it - how we usually did at least. Did we used to spend time how we actually wanted to? Our chosen friends, our work, our hobbies? More importantly, did we actually notice it? It takes a lull in our lives to reflect. For me, this was often the period between Christmas and New Year but Covid-19 has been quite the lull. As we hopefully leave the worst of it behind, I notice myself more aware of time. Not in a morbid sense: just that less of it's passing me by.
