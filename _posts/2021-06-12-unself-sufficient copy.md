> I’m fine without directions,  
> yet a fire and I’m not fine.  
> In truth I long to be not lost:  
> willing and supine.  
>*You only need ask* I hear you say  
> Though my stubborn mouth squirms tight.  
> Instead I guard, from afar,  
> worried and contrite.  
> 
>But to travel well you can’t go alone  
> or so I’ve begun to see.  
> This life is full of others too:  
> I can be the absentee.  
> So what! My mind cannot always guide me,  
>then a stranger’s will,  
> and a stranger’s hands will save me,  
> when I lack the skill.
> 
> Ask for help, let a little go,  
>now to passers-by I’ll say—  
> “I *am* a bit lost but that’s just fine  
> because we’re heading the same way.”
