  <h3>What is this website?</h3>
A semifrequent journal of thoughts, poems and pictures to help make sense of the world. A dumping ground for half-formed creative ideas: not quite the drivel in my phone's notes but not always particularly polished either.

<h3>Who is to blame for this and how do I contact them?</h3>

George Cloake. After individually struggling to achieve mediocrity at writing, poetry and photography I made the dubious decision to publicly double down and combine all three. If you wish to take this matter further you can contact me here.
