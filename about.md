<h1>Infrequently asked questions</h1>

  <h3>What is this site?</h3>
A semi-consistent journal of thoughts, poems and pictures to help make sense of the world. A dumping ground for half-formed ideas: not quite the drivel in my notes but not particularly polished either. At its core though it is my creative outlet.

<h3>Who's to blame for this?</h3>

George Cloake. After individually struggling to achieve mediocrity at writing, poetry and various visual arts I made the dubious decision to publicly triple down and combine all three. If you wish to take this matter further you can <a href="">contact me</a>.
