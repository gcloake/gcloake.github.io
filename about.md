<p class="message">
  Poems, thoughts, photographs: this site acts as my journal. The kind that probably ought to gather dust by your bedside, rather than be posted online. I enjoy reading other people's work, particularly <i>about</i> their work: their creative process and thoughts, so decided to share a little of my own. Whilst a great poem needs no introduction - this is just one big draft - and so I hope you find something of interest or even common ground.
