  Poems, thoughts, photographs: this site acts as my journal. The kind that probably ought to gather dust by your bedside, rather than be posted online.
  <br /><br />
I enjoy reading other people's work and particularly <i>about</i> their work: their creative process and feelings, so decided to share a little of my own. Whilst a great poem needs no introduction - treat this as one big draft - and so whilst you might not find greatness, perhaps there's common ground.

  If you'd like to get in touch you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeCloake">@GeorgeCloake</a>.
