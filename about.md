<p class="message">
Welcome to my poetry collection. I share most of my poems here and I hope you find at least one you like. I write poetry to better explore my thoughts and enjoy reflecting back on them afterwards. This collection is an ongoing work-in-progress and so I welcome any comments or critique to help me improve. <br />
