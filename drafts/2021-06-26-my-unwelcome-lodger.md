A heavy smog lies on my brow  
seeps down  
my neck.  
towards my nape.

*I thought you had gone?*  
I think, I wish,  
but instead you settle  
for the rest of the day.

You leave at night:  
a senseless respite,  
of calm and potential  
wasted in bed.

So long have you stayed  
that at times I don’t mind—  
just be quiet, ‘til tomorrow  
when I’ll see you again.
