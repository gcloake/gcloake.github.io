> Fears pollute some nights like oil in a well.
> A toxic sheen obscuring the altogether greater good.
> I want to drink yet I’m drawn to them,
> too fascinated to break or make a ripple.
> On edge, they’re all I see
> all I notice now.
> Awake in my bed in the city.
>
> Immiscible: that’s apparently the word,
> or just another distraction from the truth
> that I’m scared of the violence.
> Is it a mystery to you?
> I pray at least but that’s no consolation.
> Powerless to protect.
> Awake in my bed in the city.
>
> I can poke holes in the oil but it will never quite go.
> Dip your hand and it sticks:
> a vicious viscous soup.
> Do I ignore and pretend,
> take a little sip?
> No— much safer to stay away.
> Stay awake in my bed in the city.
